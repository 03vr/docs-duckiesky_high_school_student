# Markdown and Contributions {#introduction-curriculum-editing status=ready}

## Learning Markdown 

- We're going to be learning Markdown and Markduck today, and at the end of the Unit, you are going to be able to directly submit some material to change our textbook!
    - Follow [this](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/) tutorial to learn the basics of Markdown
        1. Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers.

## Learning Markduck

- What is the difference between Markdown and Markduck?
    - Markduck is a Markdown dialect that is very similar to Markdown in terms of syntax. It is the language that the majority of the Duckiesky High School Textbook (including this document) was written in. Markduck has many characteristics that make it possible to create publication-worthy materials.
        - Syntax is a set of rules and characters that define interactions for a programming language. Individual syntaxes for programming languages can give various characters and code completely different meanings.
    - There are a couple key changes in the syntax between Markdown and Markduck, but, as a whole, almost all of the features you just learned in the Markdown tutorial remain the same! 
        1. In Markduck, an unordered list is created by putting a dash (-) instead of (*).
        2. Sublists are created by using tabs instead of spaces in Markduck.
        3. In Markduck, headers are used to define pages and separate sections. For instance, the "2.2 Learning Markduck" section title is created with a heading of level two (##) whereas the title of this page "Markdown and Contributions" was created with a heading of level one (#).
    - [Read](https://docs.duckietown.org/DT19/duckumentation/out/markduck_basic.html) 1.5 Figures, 1.6 Subfigures, and 1.9 Comments.
    - Quickly skim over the section on [special characters](https://docs.duckietown.org/DT19/duckumentation/out/markduck_special_pars.html) to be aware of some of the other features that Markduck supports which you can't directly use in Markdown!
