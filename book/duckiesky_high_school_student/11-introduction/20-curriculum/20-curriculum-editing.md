# Markdown and Contributions {#introduction-curriculum-editing status=ready}

## Learning Markdown 

- We're going to be learning Markdown and Markduck today, and at the end of the Unit, you are going to be able to directly submit some material to change our textbook!
    - Follow [this](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/) tutorial to learn the basics of Markdown
        1. Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers.

## Learning Markduck

- What is the difference between Markdown and Markduck?
    - Markduck is a Markdown dialect that supports many Markdown features. It is the language that the majority of the Duckiesky High School Textbook (including this document) was written in.
    - Learn about the [special characters](https://docs.duckietown.org/DT19/duckumentation/out/markduck_special_pars.html) that Markduck supports that you can't directly use in Markdown!
