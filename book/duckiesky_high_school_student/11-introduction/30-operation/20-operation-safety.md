# Safety {#introduction-operation-safety status=ready}

 
Teachers should emphasize that the drone students are building is relatively powerful, and can cause harm to them or others if not used safely.
 
#### Case Study: The Midair Collision in 2009
 
There was a collision between a private airplane and a sightseeing helicopter over Manhattan. The result was 9 deaths.
 
There were several causes that contributed to this:
 
 
1) The limitations of the see and avoid concept:
 
9 seconds before collision, the helicopter was not seen from the airplane.
5 seconds before collision, the helicopter was still very far from view.
1 second before collision, the helicopter was too close to be able to act sufficient.
 
By the time the pilot of the airplane saw the helicopter, there was no time/not sufficient enough time to avoid the helicopter.
 
2) Teterboro Airport local controllerâ€™s non pertinent telephone conversation (New York Times).
 
The controller was distracted as he was having a phone call. He did not communicate with the pilot and was unable to warn the pilot of a potential crash.
 
3) Inadequate FAA procedures and regulations:
 
There are inadequate FAA proceuures for transfer of communications between ATC facilities along that area of where the crash occured (New York Times).
 
As well, the FAA regulations that not allow for sufficient vertical separation between aircraft flying in the region (Prof Tellex slides).

#### FAA rules
 
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is a US governmental boday that is responsible for regulating aviation and unmanned aircraft. It regulates flights outdoors, airports, air traffic management, certification of people and aircraft, and protection of US assets. FAA rules do not apply to operations that take place indoors. 
 
Students are considered to be recreational users.
 
Faculty and staff are considered to be non-recreational users.
 
Here are some of the important safety guidelines by the FAA:
 
1. Fly at or below 400 feet 

2. Be aware of airspace requirements and restrictions 

3. Stay away from surrounding obstacles 

4. Keep your UAS within sight 

5. Never fly near other aircraft, especially near airports 

6. Never fly over groups of people 

7. Never fly over stadiums or sports events 

8. Never fly near emergency response efforts such as fires 

9. Never fly under the influence of drugs or alcohol
 
#### Where to fly:
 
You may fly your drone indoors if you have enough space, as FAA rules do not apply to operations that take place indoors.
 
Before flying outside, please check the FAA's website (the Chart  User's Guide or the aeronautical charts provided) to check which airspace you are located in.
 
You may also use the B4UFLY app, which is created by the FAA to help recreational flyers to figure out where they can safely fly and/or any restrictions in a location.
 
#### Possible Sources for Danger:
 
There are several possible sources of danger that can result from the drone:
 
1) applying force to your body
2) energy discharge from the body
3) parts or propellers dislodging from the drone
4) electric shorts and fires
 
#### Safe Environment
 
The Bystander Effect:
 
The more people that are present, the less likely someone will help a victim during a situation.
 
Be wary of this, make sure that if there is a dangerous situation, be cautious and aware, and take action to help those who need it.
 
Make sure that you have a safe environment to fly indoors.
 
Make sure you have equipment:
1) Safety glasses
2) Gloves
3) Walls
4) Distance
5) Net (not required)
 
#### Pre-flight Safety Checklist
 
Before you fly, you should make sure that:
 
1. Am I connected to the correct drone?

2. Do I have my safety goggles on?

3. Do I have space to fly? 

4. Is there the possibility of the drone flying away or collisions?

5. Make sure the propellers, motors, and flight controller are not loose. 

6. Make sure there are no dangling wires or wires that are in the way of the propellers. 

7. Inspect the battery for any problems and battery level when plugged in

8. Check the kill switch and ensure that it works. 

9. Are the propellers armed?

 
#### First Flight:
 
The first time you fly the drone or start the drone, there may be some situations you may experience/be aware of:
 
- Drone flips: incorrect propellor orientations
- Collisions: no side/back sensors
- Battery mishaps: replace batteries
- Excessive heat production of the drone: shorts in soldering
- IR Sensor not working: check soldering and boltages
- Motors not responding: check calibration and soldering, run calibration script in terminal
- Haywire flight: check if flight controller is steady, make sure to run calibration script in terminal
